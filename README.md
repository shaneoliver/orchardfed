# Orchard FED Test

I requested access to the invsionapp file to inspect the elements and export the assets, but this was never provided. Instead, I've included images from Unsplash as placeholders and used system fonts.
I've used a variety of techniques included BEM class naming, CSS grid, flexbox, CSS custom properties, and Sass mixins and functions to create the components and sections.
